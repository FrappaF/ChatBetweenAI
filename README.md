# ChatBetweenAI
Chat between AI from ChatGPT in different contexts

All the images come from `https://www.flaticon.com/`

I created roughly this web page based on https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-node.git. 
You can choose from different contexts and start a conversation with a starting point and see how the AI continues. 
You can also download the current conversation.

Make sure you've installed all the node dependencies.

You can run this with `npm run dev`.
